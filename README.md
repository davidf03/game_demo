This is an interactive demo of a game interface I designed involving 3D tessellating geometry puzzles.
The goal was to take these already existing toys and construct a digital interface around them, such that their physical presence would not be compromised while opening up the numerous possibilities of a digital environment.

In addition to the puzzle layer, piece selection and comparison of the unsolved puzzle to a solid solved version, as well as organization of the remaining pieces into meaningful groups, were accounted for and planned out.

This remains one of the most extensive and complete projects in my portfolio, despite it having never been implemented.

Click on the pulsing white circles at the borders of the game screen to view all three of the four levels of the interface.
